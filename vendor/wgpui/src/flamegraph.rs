//! CPU-side flamegraph capture engine (Phase 1 of the profiling epic, see issue #57).
//!
//! This module owns the data model, per-thread span recorder, capture session
//! lifecycle, and binary trace export. It absorbs and replaces the old
//! `profiler.rs`, whose flat merge-by-location buffer could not represent
//! call-stack nesting; `CpuSpan::depth` fixes that by recording stack position
//! at push time.
//!
//! GPU timestamp capture lives in `flamegraph_gpu.rs` so that this module never
//! needs to depend on `wgpu`. The two modules communicate through the plain
//! (non-wgpu) types defined here: `GpuSpan`, `GpuPassKind`, `GpuClockCalibration`.

// Phase 3: on-demand memory snapshots (issue #59).
//
// Unlike the spans/counters above, memory sizes are not tracked continuously
// per-frame -- they're cheap to recompute from the subsystems that already
// own the data (a wgpu buffer already knows its own `size()`, an `Arena`
// already knows its own `capacity()`), so there's nothing to accumulate.
// `MemorySnapshot`/`GpuMemorySnapshot` are plain data, computed and returned
// fresh on every call.
//
// #59 suggested exposing this as `Capture::memory_snapshot()`. That doesn't
// fit the real merged shape: a stopped `Capture` (this module's only
// `Capture` type so far, see its doc comment) has no reference back to the
// live `App`/`Window`/`WgpuRenderer` state the CPU/GPU subsystems actually
// live in -- `element_arena` is on `App`, the glyph cache is on the
// process-wide `TextSystem`, the shaped-line cache and GPU renderer are
// per-`Window`. Forcing the query through `Capture` would mean threading all
// of that state into a type whose only job today is holding already-finished
// frames. Instead, each snapshot is computed where its data actually lives:
// `Window::memory_snapshot` (CPU) and `Window::gpu_memory_snapshot` (GPU),
// both `#[cfg(feature = "flamegraph")]`-gated same as everything else here.
// This mirrors, rather than fights, the same lesson phase 1/2 already
// learned about call sites with no natural path to a specific type --
// `current_gpu_correlation_frame_index` and the `FRAME_COUNTERS`
// thread-local accumulator both exist because the natural owner of the data
// (a `GpuQueryManager` generation, a draw-call counter) isn't the same place
// that has a handle to the `Capture`/`FrameCapture` it needs to reach.
// `MemorySnapshot`/`GpuMemorySnapshot` face the mirror-image version of that
// problem -- the natural owner of a `Capture` doesn't have a handle to the
// subsystems -- so they get the mirror-image fix: compute at the source
// instead of routing through `Capture`.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Phase 4: on-demand GPU deep capture (issue #60).
//
// Everything above this point is the phase 1-3 always-on-capable path: cheap
// enough (a handful of relaxed atomic loads plus, while a session is
// recording, some bookkeeping) to leave instrumented in a shipping build.
// `DeepCapture` is deliberately not part of that path. Reading back full
// buffer contents is orders of magnitude more expensive than the timestamp
// pairs `flamegraph_gpu`'s `GpuQueryManager` resolves every frame, so this
// models a completely separate, single-shot mode: armed explicitly with
// `request_deep_capture()`, fires once on the very next `WgpuRenderer::draw()`
// call, and is torn down (its wgpu staging buffers dropped) the moment
// readback completes. There is no persistent state here beyond one
// `AtomicBool` (armed?) and one `Mutex<Option<DeepCapture>>` (last completed
// result) -- the expensive state (staging buffers, in-flight command stream)
// lives entirely in `flamegraph_gpu::DeepCaptureRecorder` /
// `DeepCapturePendingReadback`, scoped to `WgpuRenderer` and only allocated
// while a capture is actually in flight.
//
// Resource contents are read back once per touched fixed buffer for the
// whole captured frame, not once per draw call boundary as a literal reading
// of "resource contents at time of use" might suggest. This is intentional:
// every fixed buffer in `WgpuContext` (`quads_buffer`, `shadows_buffer`, ...)
// is written exactly once per frame, with the *entire* frame's data for that
// primitive kind, before any draw call reads from it (see
// `WgpuRenderer::draw`'s `ensure_buffer_size`/`write_buffer` calls, which all
// happen before the render-pass loop). So a buffer's contents are already
// identical at every draw call boundary that reads it within one frame --
// reading it back per call would mean N redundant `map_async` round trips of
// the same bytes for N draw calls sharing that buffer, for zero additional
// information. Recording each draw call's `vertex_range`/`instance_range`
// alongside the once-per-buffer snapshot is exactly as informative (a viewer
// slices the snapshot using those ranges) at a fraction of the readback cost.
//
// Same "no natural path to the data" constraint phases 1-3 kept hitting
// applies here too: `WgpuContext`'s fixed buffers are `pub(super)` to
// `platform::cross`, invisible to this module and to `flamegraph_gpu.rs`
// (neither lives inside that module). Rather than widening that visibility,
// the buffer-copy commands are recorded from `WgpuRenderer::draw` itself
// (which already holds live `&wgpu::Buffer` references for its own bind-group
// setup), and only the resulting `wgpu::Buffer` staging handles/state machine
// live in `flamegraph_gpu.rs`.
