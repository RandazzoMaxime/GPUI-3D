//! Scene-side packing substrate for per-layer persistent GPU slabs (retained
//! rendering Pillar III, epic #84, spec #94, `docs/retained-layers.md` §4.2).
//!
//! [`pack_layer_items`] turns one layer's recorded [`LayerItem`]s — paint
//! order, carrying layer-local draw orders — into a [`PackedLayer`]: per-kind
//! primitive arrays sorted exactly as [`Scene::finish`](crate::scene::Scene::finish)
//! sorts the frame's flat arrays, plus a [`PackedLayer::runs`] manifest
//! describing every contiguous same-kind stretch in final draw order, so the
//! renderer can issue one instanced draw per run without re-deriving any
//! ordering at draw time.
//!
//! The output is proven equivalent to today's legacy path by golden-model
//! tests (this module's `tests`), which replay synthetic scenes through
//! `Scene::finish` + `Scene::batches` and compare primitive-for-primitive,
//! byte-for-byte modulo the draw-order field (packed arrays carry layer-local
//! orders, the legacy arrays global ones — the same relative-order-only
//! equivalence the retained-layer ordering tests establish).
//!
//! # Kill switch
//!
//! Everything here sits behind [`slabs_enabled`] (`WGPUI_SLABS`, default on,
//! read once — the `WGPUI_LAYERS` precedent). Every frame-path consumer
//! checks the switch before doing work, so with it off the packing code is
//! simply never reached and the legacy per-frame path stands.
//!
//! # Fail-loud policy
//!
//! A layer whose content cannot be expressed as slab instances — `Surface`,
//! `BackdropFilter` or `FilterBoundary` primitives — must fall back to the
//! legacy per-frame path rather than pack partially: silently dropping one
//! would silently drop visible pixels. Rejections warn once, bump a `slab:`
//! render counter, and `debug_assert!`; the caller receives
//! [`PackOutcome::FellBack`] and composites that layer the old way. The same
//! applies to path items whose recorded ids are inconsistent (two paths
//! claiming one id — a producer that skipped id reassignment), which is the
//! only way "missing path data" can manifest, because items carry their path
//! geometry inline; see "Path ids" below.
//!
//! # Path ids
//!
//! A captured path's `id` addresses the *recording* frame's `Scene::paths`
//! array and means nothing afterwards. Packing renumbers ids densely per
//! layer (`packed.paths[i].id == i`) and counts path runs in **vertices**,
//! making the packed data fully self-contained: the renderer uploads
//! `paths[i].vertices` concatenated in array order and never resolves an id
//! against any global array. Splicing into legacy global draws later is pure
//! offset arithmetic (append the layer's vertex block at the current global
//! vertex count); no recorded global `PathId` survives the pack, which
//! removes the dangling-reference hazard by construction instead of trying to
//! detect it at use time.
//!
//! # What the consuming wave may rely on
//!
//! - Each non-path kind's array *is* the slab's content in order;
//!   `KindRun::start/count` are instance indices into it (and, offset by the
//!   layer's `SlabRange` base, into the global buffer).
//! - `SlabKind::Paths` runs address the layer's flattened vertex stream:
//!   prefix sums of `paths[i].vertices.len()` define each path's sub-range,
//!   and [`PackedLayer::total_path_vertices`] sizes the reservation handed to
//!   the slab allocator.
//! - Sprite runs never span two atlas textures (`texture_id` is `Some`
//!   exactly for sprite kinds); adjacent same-kind runs may share a texture
//!   only where the legacy batch iterator split a batch at an order threshold
//!   — merging such neighbours is left to the renderer if it ever wants
//!   fewer draws.
//! - `LayerItem::Nested` references are never packed here; a nested layer is
//!   its own retained record, packed independently under its own key.

// The renderer consumes `PackedLayer` through the scene's spans; the
// `dead_code` allowance stays because not every helper here has a non-test
// caller yet.
