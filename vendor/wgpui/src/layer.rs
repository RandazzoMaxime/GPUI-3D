//! Retained layers: explicit, named, independently invalidated units of caching.
//!
//! A layer is the first piece of genuinely *retained* state in the renderer. It
//! is modelled on `CALayer`: created explicitly, addressed by a stable key,
//! independently invalidated, and independently composited.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! div().id("properties-panel").layer().child(expensive_content)
//! ```
//!
//! [`Element::layer`](crate::InteractiveElement::layer) requires an
//! [`ElementId`](crate::ElementId), and that requirement is the point. A
//! layer's entire value is surviving across frames, so it must have a name that
//! survives across frames too. The cache this replaces was implicit and
//! anonymous, addressed by raw offsets into per-frame arrays — which is why a
//! range that aged by one frame could slice out of bounds, and why
//! `Window::invalid_reuse_range` exists as a hand-maintained fifteen-field
//! guard. A layer is addressed by [`LayerKey`], so there is nothing to age.
//!
//! # What is retained in this phase
//!
//! Primitives, at layer granularity: a composited layer re-emits its recorded
//! primitives with their recorded *layer-local* draw orders, which is what
//! lets it skip both primitive emission and the per-primitive `BoundsTree`
//! insert that dominates `Scene::insert_primitive`.
//!
//! As of #92, a layer that *is* re-rendering can additionally reconcile at
//! element granularity — see [`Layer::instances`] and [`crate::instance`] —
//! so one changed child no longer forces every sibling through `prepaint`/
//! `paint` again. As of #96 a layer can additionally be *texture-retained*:
//! its content lives in a persistent renderer-side texture and a clean frame
//! composites it with a single surface draw — see [`Layer::texture_retained`].
//!
//! Hitboxes, dispatch nodes, tooltips and shaped text still travel through the
//! old index-range replay path, which stays until #97 — see
//! [`Layer::paint_range`].
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Each layer paints into its own ordering scope with its own `BoundsTree`
//! starting at zero (see [`crate::scene::Scene`]). Inter-layer ordering is
//! decided by where the layer was entered in its parent's scope, and the
//! composite step at `Scene::finish` maps every scope's local orders into a
//! global order range reserved for it.
//!
//! **Order invalidation is per-layer, not per-primitive.** If any content in a
//! layer changes bounds, that layer's tree re-inserts and its primitives
//! re-sort; content in other layers is untouched. This implies a sizing rule
//! that is easy to get wrong: **layer boundaries should separate content by
//! update frequency, not only by visual grouping.** A layer holding one
//! 120Hz-animating element and a thousand static ones re-sorts all thousand
//! every frame, and will look fine while being slower than no layer at all.
//! `WGPUI_LAYER_DEBUG=1` is how that gets diagnosed.
