//! Replay engine (Phase 6 of the profiling epic, see issue #62): reconstructs
//! and re-drives a previously triggered frame outside the code path that
//! originally produced it, building on Phase 4's [`crate::DeepCapture`] (GPU
//! command stream + fixed-buffer resource contents) and Phase 5's
//! [`crate::UiTreeCapture`] (element tree/layout/style/Scene snapshot).
//!
//! # Scope decisions (see the progress comments on issue #62 for the full
//! reasoning)
//!
//! 1. **In-process replay only, not from-disk trace deserialization.** Phase
//!    1's trace types (`FrameCapture` and friends, `flamegraph.rs`) are
//!    `Serialize`-only -- several fields hold `&'static str`, which blocks a
//!    clean `'static`-bound `Deserialize` impl (see that module's own
//!    doc comment). Building real owned-mirror `Deserialize` support for the
//!    binary trace format is a separate, harder problem than replay itself,
//!    so this module replays directly against a live [`crate::DeepCapture`]/
//!    [`crate::UiTreeCapture`] value already sitting in the calling process
//!    (typically just taken from [`crate::take_completed_deep_capture`]/
//!    [`crate::take_completed_ui_tree_capture`]), not a file loaded from
//!    disk days later. That is also what an in-app viewer (phase 7,
//!    `WGPUI-Component`) primarily wants: scrub what was just captured.
//! 2. **In-crate module behind `feature = "flamegraph"`, not a separate
//!    crate.** The viewer lives in a different repo but already depends on
//!    `gpui` directly, so a gated module costs it nothing extra to consume,
//!    versus standing up and validating a new workspace member.
//!
//! # GPU replay fidelity
//!
//! [`render_deep_capture_step`] re-submits a captured draw call's raw,
//! fixed-buffer resource bytes to a real [`wgpu::Device`]/[`wgpu::Queue`],
//! through the *actual* production shader for that draw call's kind
//! (`platform/cross/shaders/*.wgsl`, `include_str!`'d verbatim). Every
//! buffer-backed kind -- `Quads`, `Shadows`, `Underlines`,
//! `BackdropFilters`, `Paths` -- is wired up to a real pipeline this round.
//! Each of these shaders reads its instance/vertex data directly out of a
//! raw storage buffer (`Quads`/`Shadows`/`Underlines`/`BackdropFilters`
//! indexed by `@builtin(instance_index)`, `Paths` indexed by
//! `@builtin(vertex_index)` -- see `render_paths_step`'s doc comment for why
//! that one differs), so the exact bytes Phase 4 read back from the live
//! `WgpuContext` buffer (`platform/cross/render_context.rs`) can be
//! uploaded to a fresh buffer and drawn with unchanged pipeline state -- no
//! host-side decoding of the shader's struct fields is needed to reproduce
//! the GPU's fragment output, only to know *which* range within the buffer
//! a given draw call covers (already recorded on
//! [`crate::DeepCaptureDrawCall`]). `render_quads_step`/`render_shadows_step`/
//! `render_underlines_step`/`render_paths_step` share this recipe via
//! `create_globals_bind_group`/`create_storage_bind_group`/
//! `render_pipeline_offscreen`; only the shader module, entry points,
//! primitive topology, and bind group visibility actually differ per kind,
//! matched against `WgpuPipelines::new` in `renderer.rs` rather than
//! guessed. `render_backdrop_filters_step` follows the same recipe for its
//! own `@group(1)` instance buffer, but also needs a `@group(2)` texture +
//! sampler (the content being blurred) that Phase 4 never captures at all --
//! see that function's doc comment for how it degrades just that one input.
//!
//! `MonoSprites`/`PolySprites` (atlas-textured) now replay with real atlas
//! texture content too, once Phase 4b (issue #72) landed atlas/surface
//! texture readback (`DeepCapture::texture_contents`,
//! `DeepCaptureTextureContents`): `render_mono_sprites_step`/
//! `render_poly_sprites_step` follow the same buffer-backed recipe for their
//! own instance buffer (`@group(3)`/`@group(2)` respectively), plus a real
//! `@group(2)`/`@group(1)` atlas texture + sampler built from the captured
//! bytes (`create_atlas_texture_bind_group`) instead of a placeholder.
//! `MonoSprites` also needs a `ColorAdjustments` uniform Phase 4 never
//! captures; `create_color_adjustments_bind_group`'s doc comment explains
//! why an all-zero default is a safe, documented simplification there.
//!
//! `Surfaces` still degrades to a generated checkerboard placeholder
//! ([`placeholder_checkerboard_rgba`]) via [`render_deep_capture_step`]
//! even though its texture *content* is now capturable -- [`DeepCaptureDrawCall`]
//! has no per-call geometry (a `Surfaces` draw call's `SurfaceParams`:
//! `bounds`/`content_mask`) to position/mask a replayed quad with, and that
//! is a distinct gap from texture-content readback itself, out of scope for
//! issue #72 as filed. [`DeepCaptureReplay::resource_status`] reports
//! [`DrawCallResourceStatus::TextureContentUnavailable`] for every
//! `Surfaces` draw call unconditionally for this same reason, regardless of
//! whether that specific surface's bytes were actually captured -- "nothing
//! to replay faithfully" remains true either way until that follow-up
//! geometry capture exists.
